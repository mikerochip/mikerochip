# Sup Everyone ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

I'm a generalist engineer in the video game industry.

I love coding and I love learning new things. Software is a great field for that, it turns out! When I write code, I try to make it easy to learn and maintain so it can stand the test of time. My mantra is to maximize the joy and minimize the stress of working with my code, with a healthy dose of pragmatism.

My claims to fame are being one of the earliest engineers on Hearthstone and a co-founder of Second Dinner, where I built the core tech and backend for Marvel Snap, with no prior backend shipping experience. This was attributed to having an [essentially problem-free launch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/second-dinner-nuverse-case-study/)

I'm also quite proud of building my C++/Lua game engine from scratch to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
