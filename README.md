* I [wrote an article](https://medium.com/macoclock/my-multi-account-github-workflow-on-mac-133708a93544) on getting multiple GitHub accounts to work on Mac after Google searching led to disappointment.

## My work and project highlights
* In the game industry my whole career so far!
* Currently focused on platform, tools, DX & UX. Used to focus on gameplay and UI.
* I optimize code for life, as opposed to time or space. LifeOptimization = Reduce(TimeToLearn, MaintenanceBurden)
* I focus on business value and team productivity at work so I can tinker on side projects
* Most professional experience is in Unity, C#, .NET, AWS
* Things I've been learning recently: Unreal, Google Cloud, CMake + Conan, TeamCity, Swift
