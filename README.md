## Other stuff about me
* In the game industry my whole career so far!
* Currently most of what I build is related platforms, workflows, tools, etc. I focused on gameplay and UI earlier in my career.
* Most professional experience is in Unity, C#, .NET, AWS
* I selected the tech and built the backend foundation for Marvel Snap, which was attributed to having an [essentially problem-free launch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/second-dinner-nuverse-case-study/)
* I optimize code for "life" not time or space, meaning I reduce time-to-learn and maintenance-burden
* I do hands on tinkering to learn tech (see [this](https://github.com/mikerochip/swift-experiments) or [this](https://github.com/mikerochip/ergonomic-cpp)
* Built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days called Hope Engine to power [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
