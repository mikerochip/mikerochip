# Welcome to my Jit Hoob

My name's Mike.

I'm a generalist engineer in video games. My claims to fame are working on World of Warcraft (UI), Hearthstone (Gameplay), and Marvel Snap (Everything). I also built a custom C++/Lua game engine to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800) (not open source...yet?). See more about me on [my website](https://mikeschweitzer.com/about/).

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹
