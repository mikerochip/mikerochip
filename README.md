Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

## Work and project highlights
* In the game industry my whole career so far!
* Currently focused on platform, tools, DX & UX. Used to focus on gameplay and UI.
* I optimize code for life, as opposed to time or space. Most of the effort goes toward learnability and maintainability.
* I focus on business value and team productivity at work so I can tinker on side projects
* Most professional experience is in Unity, C#, .NET, AWS
* A few things I've been learning most recently: Unreal, GCP, CMake + Conan, TeamCity, Swift
* Built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days called Hope Engine to power [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)

## Tech writing
* The Unity game engine has a package called Addressables. I wrote a manual for it after banging my head against the wall. [Addressables Training Manual](https://github.com/mikerochip/addressables-training-manual)
* I wrote an article on getting multiple GitHub accounts to work on Mac after Google searching led me down dark paths. [My multi-account GitHub workflow on Mac](https://medium.com/macoclock/my-multi-account-github-workflow-on-mac-133708a93544)
