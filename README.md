# Welcome to my Jit Hoob ðŸ‘‹

You're probably here to learn more about my tech schtuff. Hello! Sup! How are you? My name's Mike.

I'm a generalist engineer in video games. My claims to fame are working on World of Warcraft (UI), Hearthstone (Gameplay), and Marvel Snap (Everything).

I was one of the decision makers for moving Hearthstone from a custom game engine to Unity, and I wrote the first Unity code for that project. I was the technical co-founder of Second Dinner and built the core tech and backend for Marvel Snap, from nothing. I also built a custom C++/Lua game engine to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800). I try to make code easy to work with and learn. That usually means thinking deeply about how people will interact with what I build. However, I also include healthy doses of pragmatism in what I do, otherwise I wouldn't get anything done.
