# Sup foolios ðŸ‘‹

At work, I'm a co-founder and Principal Engineer at [Second Dinner](https://seconddinner.com/). I worked at Blizzard for a super long time before that.\
At home, I'm a husband and autism dad of a baby girl and a sphynx cat.

### Tech Stuff

* I built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days that powers [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
* Most of my professional experience as of late is in C#, and mostly Unity and .NET Core using AWS Serverless services
* On team projects, I like to spend most of my time making sure the project is maintainable, the glue between modules is really tight, and generally pay a lot of attention to understandability and DX
* On personal projects, I like to learn by doing, experiment with new tech and scratch the itches that I'd want to scratch on work projects if it weren't irresponsible to do so
* Swift is my latest learning journey. It's really elegant and powerful, but lacks built-in async, lacks base class and third party libraries (vs .NET), and is fairly hard to learn.
* Speaking of languages, my first language is Java
