# Welcome to my Jit Hoob

My name's Mike.

My claims to fame are working on World of Warcraft (UI), Hearthstone (Gameplay), and Marvel Snap (Everything). I also built a custom C++/Lua game engine to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800). You can read more [here](https://mikeschweitzer.com/about/).
