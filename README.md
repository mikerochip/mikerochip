Welcome to my Jit Hoob. I wonder what folks want to know when they stumble here?

## At work...
* Co-founder, Principal Engineer at [Second Dinner](https://seconddinner.com/)
* Before that, worked at Blizzard for longer than anyone should stay at one job
* I focus on business value and team productivity. Lots of effort towards glue, maintainability, understandability, and DX.
* I work responsibly so I can be irresponsible on personal projects
* Work tech lately is Unity, C#, .NET, and AWS serverless

## At home...
* Husband and dad to an autistic baby girl and sphynx cat
* Built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days called Hope Engine to power [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
* Last few learning journeys were Swift, Pulumi, how app backends work
* Chrono Trigger is the best video game ever made
