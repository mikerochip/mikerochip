Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

## At work...
* Co-founder, Principal Engineer at [Second Dinner](https://seconddinner.com/)
* Before that, worked at Blizzard for longer than anyone should stay at one job
* I focus on business value and team productivity. Lots of effort towards glue work, maintainability, understandability, and DX.
* I work responsibly so I can be irresponsible on personal projects
* Work tech lately is Unity, C#, .NET, and AWS serverless

## At home...
* Husband and dad to an autistic baby girl and sphynx cat
* Built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days called Hope Engine to power [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
* Last few learning journeys were Swift, Pulumi, how app backends work
* Love Chrono Trigger

## Tech writing
* The Unity game engine has a package called Addressables. I wrote a manual for it after banging my head against the wall. [Addressables Training Manual](https://github.com/mikerochip/addressables-training-manual)
* I wrote an article on getting multiple GitHub accounts to work on Mac after Google searching led me down dark paths. [My multi-account GitHub workflow on Mac](https://medium.com/macoclock/my-multi-account-github-workflow-on-mac-133708a93544)
