# Sup Everyone ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

I mainly optimize code for "life" not speed or memory. I try to make my code easy to learn and maintain so it can stand the test of time.

My claim to fame is selecting the tech stack and building the backend foundation for Marvel Snap, which was attributed to having an [essentially problem-free launch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/second-dinner-nuverse-case-study/)

I'm also quite proud of building a C++/Lua game engine from scratch to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
