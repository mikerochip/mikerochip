# Sup Everyone ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

I'm a generalist engineer in the video game industry.

I love coding and learning new tech. When I write code, I try to make it easy to read and maintain so it can stand the test of time. My mantra is to maximize the joy and minimize the stress of working with my code. I include a healthy dose of pragmatism since most of my professional work has been deployed directly to players.

My claims to fame are working on World of Warcraft, being one of the earliest engineers on Hearthstone, and being a co-founder of Second Dinner. I built the core tech and backend for Marvel Snap, without prior experience shipping backend infrastructure. This led to an [essentially problem-free launch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/second-dinner-nuverse-case-study/)

I'm also proud of building my C++/Lua game engine from scratch to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
