# Sup Everyone ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

* In the game industry my whole career so far
* Currently most of what I build is related to platforms, workflows, tools. Once upon a time, I focused on gameplay and UI.
* Most professional experience is in Unity, C#, .NET, AWS
* I mainly optimize code for "life" not speed or memory. I try to make my code easy to learn and maintain so it can stand the test of time.
* I selected the tech and built the backend foundation for Marvel Snap, which was attributed to having an [essentially problem-free launch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/second-dinner-nuverse-case-study/)
* I sometimes tinker to learn new tech, like [this Swift thing](https://github.com/mikerochip/swift-experiments) or [this C++ thing](https://github.com/mikerochip/ergonomic-cpp)
* Built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days called Hope Engine to power [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
