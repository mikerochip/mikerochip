# Sup foolios ðŸ‘‹

At work, I'm a co-founder and Principal Engineer at [Second Dinner](https://seconddinner.com/). I worked at Blizzard for a super long time before that.

At home, I'm a husband and autism dad of a baby girl and a baby sphynx.

### Tech Stuff

* I built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days that powers [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
* Currently build lots of platform tech at work, mostly C# in Unity and .NET Core on AWS Serverless
* I try to stay up to date on tech and enjoy learning new tech and tools, Swift is my latest journey
* I'm sure this will all be out of date by the time you read this, dear reader
