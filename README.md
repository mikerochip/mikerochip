# Welcome to my Jit Hoob

My name's Mike.

I'm a generalist engineer in video games. My claims to fame are working on World of Warcraft (UI), Hearthstone (Gameplay), and Marvel Snap (Everything).

I was one of the decision makers for moving Hearthstone to Unity after it was on a custom game engine. I was the technical co-founder of Second Dinner and built the core tech and backend for Marvel Snap from scratch. I also built a custom C++/Lua game engine to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800).

See [my website](https://mikeschweitzer.com/about/) if you want to know more about me, and see my pinned repositories if you're interested in game dev utilities.

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹
