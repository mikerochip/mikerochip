Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

## Stuff you might find useful
* If you're a Unity dev, any of my repos that start with [unity-](https://github.com/mikerochip?tab=repositories&q=unity-)
* Unity has a downloadable asset management system called Addressables. I wrote a [manual](https://github.com/mikerochip/addressables-training-manual) for it.
* Any of my repos with [-training-manual](https://github.com/mikerochip?tab=repositories&q=-training-manual) may help you
* I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/macoclock/my-multi-account-github-workflow-on-mac-133708a93544) on getting multiple GitHub accounts to work on Mac with ssh.
  * BUT you should probably just use https, [GCM](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/install.md), and [`[includeIf "gitdir:~/path/to/.config"]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)

## Some highlights
* In the game industry my whole career so far!
* Currently focused on tech foundations (platform, workflow, tools, etc). Focused on gameplay and UI earlier in career.
* Most professional experience is in Unity, C#, .NET, AWS
* I optimize code for "life" not time or space, meaning I reduce time-to-learn and maintenance-burden
* I tinker on side projects to [learn tech](https://github.com/mikerochip/swift-experiments) or make [proofs of concept](https://github.com/mikerochip/ergonomic-cpp)
* Built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days called Hope Engine to power [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
