Welcome to my Jit Hoob!

## At work...
* Previously Second Dinner, Blizzard Entertainment. In the game industry my whole career so far!
* Engineer focused on platform, tools, DX & UX, business value, and team productivity
* I optimize for life, as opposed to time and memory: lot of effort towards glue work, learnability, maintainability
* I work responsibly so I can be irresponsible on side projects
* Tech is Unreal, C++. Huge stints in Unity, C#, .NET, AWS serverless (Lambda, Dynamo, API Gateway, SNS, SQS, others).

## At home...
* Husband and dad to a lovely wife, an autistic baby girl, and a sphynx cat
* Built a C++/Lua game engine in the early iOS days called Hope Engine to power [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800)
* Last few learning journeys: Unreal, C++11, Swift, Pulumi, how app backends work
* Love Chrono Trigger

## Tech writing
* The Unity game engine has a package called Addressables. I wrote a manual for it after banging my head against the wall. [Addressables Training Manual](https://github.com/mikerochip/addressables-training-manual)
* I wrote an article on getting multiple GitHub accounts to work on Mac after Google searching led me down dark paths. [My multi-account GitHub workflow on Mac](https://medium.com/macoclock/my-multi-account-github-workflow-on-mac-133708a93544)
