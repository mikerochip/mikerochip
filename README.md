# Welcome to my Jit Hoob ðŸ‘‹

I'm a generalist engineer in the video game industry. My claims to fame are working on World of Warcraft (UI), Hearthstone (Gameplay), and Marvel Snap (Everything).

I'm proud of a few things in my career. I was a decision maker for moving Hearthstone from a custom game engine to Unity. I was the technical co-founder of Second Dinner and built the core tech and backend for Marvel Snap without prior experience building a backend from nothing. My tech choices led to an [essentially problem-free launch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/second-dinner-nuverse-case-study/), which tells me that I can do things right, sometimes. I also built a custom C++/Lua game engine to power my self-published iOS game [Mecha Drop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mecha-drop/id415230800).

I try to make code easy to work with and learn. That usually means thinking deeply about details and outcomes. I include healthy doses of pragmatism in order to get things done.
